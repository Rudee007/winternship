# Hackathon FAQ

## General Information

### Q: What is a hackathon?
**A:** A hackathon is a time-bound event where participants work individually or in teams to develop innovative solutions to given problem statements or challenges within a limited timeframe.

### Q: Where can I find event-specific information?
**A:** All hackathon information, updates, and announcements are shared in the official Cliq channel. Make sure you're added to the channel and check it regularly for important updates.

### Q: When will I receive the orientation information?
**A:** A YouTube orientation video will be shared before the hackathon begins. This video contains essential information about the event, so make sure to watch it completely.

### Q: When are the problem statements released?
**A:** Problem statements are released on the morning of the hackathon start day. They will be shared in the Cliq channel, so be ready to access them as soon as the event begins.

## Prototype Development

### Q: Do I need to build a working prototype?
**A:** Making a prototype is optional but highly recommended. It can significantly strengthen your submission and demonstrate the feasibility of your idea.

### Q: What if I don't have technical skills to build a prototype?
**A:** Focus on creating a detailed concept with clear explanations, mockups, or wireframes. A well-thought-out idea with proper presentation can be just as valuable.

## Submission Requirements

### Q: What do I need to submit for the hackathon?
**A:** Common submission requirements typically include:

1. **Project Presentation**: A slide deck or presentation explaining your solution
2. **Demo/Pitch Video**: A short video (usually 2-5 minutes) demonstrating your idea
3. **Source Code Repository**: Link to your GitHub/GitLab repository with proper documentation
4. **Project Documentation**: Clear README file and any additional documentation

*Note: Specific requirements vary by hackathon. Always check the official guidelines for your event.*

### Q: When is the submission deadline?
**A:** Submission deadlines vary by event. Check your hackathon's official timeline and plan to submit at least 30 minutes before the deadline to account for technical issues.

### Q: What should be included in the demo/pitch video?
**A:** Your video should typically cover:
- Problem statement you're addressing
- Your proposed solution
- Key features and benefits
- How your solution works (demo if available)
- Impact and potential of your idea
- Team introduction (if applicable)

### Q: What should the presentation include?
**A:** You must follow the provided PowerPoint template for your presentation. The template will be shared with specific slides and format requirements. Make sure to:
- Use the exact template provided
- Fill in all required sections
- Follow the specified format and structure
- Include all mandatory elements as outlined in the template

## GitHub Repository

### Q: What should be included in the GitHub repository?
**A:** Your repository should contain:
- Clear and comprehensive README file
- Source code (if prototype developed)
- Documentation
- Setup/installation instructions
- Project structure explanation
- Screenshots or demo links

### Q: What makes a good README file?
**A:** A proper README should include:
- Project title and description
- Problem statement addressed
- Solution overview
- Technologies used
- Installation and setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Screenshots or demo videos
- Team member information
- Future enhancements planned

### Q: Do I need to make my repository public?
**A:** Yes, ensure your repository is public so judges can access it easily.

## Technical Considerations

### Q: Are there any restrictions on programming languages or technologies?
**A:** Technology restrictions vary by hackathon. Some events may specify certain platforms, APIs, or technologies to use, while others are completely open. Always check the specific rules and guidelines for your event.

### Q: Can I use existing libraries and frameworks?
**A:** Most hackathons allow and encourage the use of existing libraries, frameworks, and APIs to build solutions efficiently. However, using pre-built solutions that directly solve the problem statement is typically not allowed.

### Q: What if my code doesn't work perfectly?
**A:** Judges understand hackathon time constraints. Focus on demonstrating your concept, approach, and problem-solving process. Document known issues, attempted solutions, and planned fixes in your documentation.

## Team and Collaboration

### Q: Can I participate as a team?
**A:** Yes, the hackathon is designed for team participation. Each team must have exactly 4 members. Make sure to form your team before the event begins or participate in team formation activities if provided.

### Q: What if I don't have a team of 4 people?
**A:** If you don't have a complete team, check the Cliq channel for team formation announcements or reach out to other participants looking for team members. The organizers may also facilitate team formation at the beginning of the event.

### Q: How should team contributions be documented?
**A:** Clearly document each team member's role and contributions in your presentation, README file, and any team introduction materials. This helps judges understand the collaborative effort.

## Presentation and Judging

### Q: What are judges looking for?
**A:** Typically judges evaluate:
- Innovation and creativity
- Technical feasibility
- Problem-solution fit
- Presentation quality
- Potential impact
- Implementation quality (if prototype exists)

### Q: How important is the presentation compared to the technical implementation?
**A:** Both are important. A great idea with poor presentation might not get the recognition it deserves, while a well-presented mediocre idea might score higher.

## Common Issues and Tips

### Q: Where should I look for updates during the hackathon?
**A:** All important updates, clarifications, and announcements will be posted in the Cliq channel. Keep the channel notifications enabled and check regularly throughout the event.

### Q: What if I can't access the Cliq channel or other resources?
**A:** Contact the hackathon organizers immediately if you can't access the Cliq channel or any shared resources. This is the primary communication channel, so access is essential for participation.

### Q: Any tips for time management during the hackathon?
**A:** 
- Start by thoroughly understanding the problem and requirements
- Plan your solution architecture before coding
- Focus on core functionality first, then add features
- Allocate time for testing, documentation, and presentation preparation
- Set intermediate milestones and deadlines
- Leave buffer time for unexpected issues

### Q: What if I encounter technical difficulties during development?
**A:** 
- Document the challenges you faced and your problem-solving approach
- Explain your intended solution and alternative approaches considered
- Show what you were able to accomplish despite the difficulties
- Demonstrate your learning process and adaptability

## Contact and Support

### Q: Who should I contact if I have questions during the hackathon?
**A:** Post your questions in the Cliq channel where organizers and mentors can respond. This also helps other participants who might have similar questions. For urgent or private matters, contact the organizers directly through the contact information provided in the channel.

### Q: What if I miss the submission deadline?
**A:** Late submission policies vary by event. Some hackathons have grace periods, while others strictly enforce deadlines. Contact organizers immediately if you encounter submission issues near the deadline.
